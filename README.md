# Array methods, reduce, and you

This is a morning challenge designed to get you feeling more confident with
array methods in javascript, via the reduce method.

After this morning challenge you should understand what some of the methods
discussed in the challenge do, and be comfortable with at least the basics of
how reduce works.

You are not expected to complete all of the functions, just do your best.

In order to do the challenge, clone and cd into the repo, run `npm i`, and then
run `npm test` and look at the results.

Now, open `index.js`, read the comments, and get working on the functions!

Remember to regularly run the tests to see how you're getting on.

Oh, and ask one of the alumni what their favourite function is, see what they
say :wink:
